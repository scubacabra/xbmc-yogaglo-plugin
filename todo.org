* version 0.1

** Fixes
   Just try except and if an error comes up give it a default name of its style of yoga
* version 0.1.1
  fixes to 0.1's bugs
* version 0.2
** Logging in with xbmc settings from configure
** Initial Code Refactory
** If no cookie file is present attempts to log on to YogaGlo when the class is initialized.
** If there is a cookie present assumes that you are logged on, I haven't had any problems with cookie expiring yet.
*** BUGS
    Cookie file is present but is expired -- code shows as logged on, but definitely need to re-log on
* version 0.2.1
  Fix of expired cookie session -- not the way I would want it, but I think session expiration is handled on yg's server so impossible to tell from cookie when expires
  solution was to try and use cookie to get on to myaccounttoday.php and search for 'Welcome back' if this doesn't work then we need to login again.
* version 0.3
  Adding video information to info menu - teacher, level, duration, style
* version 0.3.1
** DONE Refactor BeautifulSoup Crawler Code to it's own class
   CLOSED: [2013-12-30 Mon 11:42]
   might someday be class oriented getting info from files to compare for new classes and stuff.
   For now just to organize code better.

***** DONE utf-8 characters (Noah Maze)
      CLOSED: [2014-01-02 Thu 15:40]

****** Apparently for Noah, his name is given in unicode but not like in the menu, it is converted from percent encoding
       so it is represented by %C3%A9 -> \xc3\xa9.  I prefer \xe3, but oh well.
